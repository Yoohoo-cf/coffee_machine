# Python Coffee Machine Project

Welcome to the Python Coffee Machine project! This script simulates a virtual coffee machine, where users can order espresso, latte, or cappuccino, insert coins, and get their desired coffee if the transaction is successful. It's a simple command-line application that showcases basic Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditionals.

## Features

- Interactive coffee machine menu
- Check resource availability for water, milk, and coffee
- Process coin input and calculate total amount inserted
- Check transaction success and provide change if necessary
- Update machine resources after dispensing coffee
- Generate a report on current resource levels and revenue

## How to Use

To use the coffee machine program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yoohoo-cf/coffee_machine.git
    cd coffee_machine
    ```
2. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a coffee or view the machine's report.

Here are the possible commands:

- Type `espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino` to select your coffee.
- Insert the number of coins required when prompted.
- Type `report` to view available resources and money earned.
- Type `off` to turn off the coffee machine (exit the program).

## Dependencies

This script is written in Python and requires no external libraries. It was created using Python 3.x and should be run using Python 3.
